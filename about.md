Heya! My name's Carson and I'd like to welcome you to my blog.

This blog is full of my experiences as a college student and as a developing industry professional. If you want to see how I've approached problems, the things I've made, and the experiences I want to share, this is the best place to do so.

## Education:

I am currently studying computer science and geography at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I've become more and more interested in continuing past my bachelor's degrees and into graduate studies. I hope to keep you updated as that path becomes more set in stone.

## Work Experience:

Occasionally, I will talk about my experience as a teaching assistant, which is one of my favorite positions I've been able to fulfill. I've been a teaching assistant since my freshman year during the spring semester. I've currently taught two different classes: Introduction to C++ and Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures.

## Hobbies:

I think we can learn a lot about ourselves through our hobbies, which is why I believe this section to be important.

I really enjoy reading! My favorite series is the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. I haven't finished it yet, but it's extremely compelling and I can easily finish the books in just a few days.

I also really enjoy cooking! I love cooking for others and trying to cook new foods, or foods that family has cooked for me before. It's a great way to connect with people, relax, and still be productive.

I'm also a fan of music! I recently started collecting vinyl, and am proud to say that I've collected three albums from one of my favorite artists: King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.
