The purpose of this blog is to remained focused on the larger projects and activities I participate in. It is largely intended to be used as a sort of portfolio showcasing the things I'm proud of. 

Currently there aren't any plans to create consistent posts on the platform. Not that I don't do anything worthwhile, it's just hard to create content consistently with a high enough quality.

Feel free to explore, read more about me, and the things I've done.

Any inquiries or comments can be sent to my email carson.desotel@gmail.com

Thank you very much! Have a great day!
