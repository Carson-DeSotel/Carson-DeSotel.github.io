## About Me
I'm a professional software engineer located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Currently working in the healthcare space as a fullstack developer. I specialize in backend development focusing on data and API tools. 

Between workdays, I like to spend my time feeding as many people as I can, running Dungeons and Dragons, listening to new music, and spending time with my partner and our kitties.
