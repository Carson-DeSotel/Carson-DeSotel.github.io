I'm giving in! 

Years ago, I stubbornly decided that I was *better* than pre-built themes and renderers. I wanted to build my own! 

Thankfully, the urge to roll my own website has died down and I'm now prioritizing style and usability on mobile platforms!

I hope that I will find more use out of this website now, and I'll continue posting to the blog as I see fit! 

Stick around!

Thanks,
Carson
