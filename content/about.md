Hey! Welcome to my page! 

I'm Carson, a professional software developer and amateur everything else.

In 2022, I finished out my Bachelor's programs at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and received my degrees in Computer Science and Geography.

Since then, I've been working at Optum on several different applications and data platforms.

Outside of work, I like to spend time playing games of any sort. It's my favorite way to exercise my brain and spend time with the people I love. 

I like to pursue other hobbies too: like cooking, going to concerts, and painting!
