# Carson-DeSotel.github.io

This is my personal website that's located at [https://www.carsondesotel.com/](https://www.carsondesotel.com/).

---

## Prerequisites:
This website is built on the following technologies:

- Jekyll
- Ruby
- RubyGems
- Bundler

I'm using Arch Locally, so [this wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Jekyll) has been useful for installing and managing these softwares on my machine.

## Downloading:
If you wish to experiment with this project on your machine, you can install this from git by cloning to your own machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Carson-DeSotel/Carson-DeSotel.github.io.git
```

You could alternatively use the ssh download link if that's how your system is set up.

## Launching Locally:
To launch a local version of this website, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

The short version is to run the following commands:

```bash

# install any needed Gems
bundle install

# serve the website on port 4000
bundle exec jekyll serve

```

and then you can navigate to https://localhost:4000 to view the site.
