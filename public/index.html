  <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professional software engineer located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Currently working in the healthcare space as a fullstack developer. I specialize in backend development focusing on data and API tools.</p>
<p>Between workdays, I like to spend my time feeding as many people as I can, running Dungeons and Dragons, listening to new music, and spending time with my partner and our kitties.</p>

        I&rsquo;m giving in!
Years ago, I stubbornly decided that I was better than pre-built themes and renderers. I wanted to build my own!
Thankfully, the urge to roll my own website has died down and I&rsquo;m now prioritizing style and usability on mobile platforms!
I hope that I will find more use out of this website now, and I&rsquo;ll continue posting to the blog as I see fit!
Stick around!
