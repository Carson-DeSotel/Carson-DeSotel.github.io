I"w<p>My experiences working for a Fortune 7 company.</p>

<h2 id="my-summer">My Summer:</h2>
<p>Well, this past summer I had an 8 week internship at Optum. I was enrolled in their Technology Development Program on a software development team where I was lucky enough to be able to work with incredible people on an amazing project. Throughout this, we were signed up to present to Optum executives as part of their Shark Tank program, a program that provided us interns the ability to market our products and receive feedback from people that may be using it. Because of our performance in those presentations, my team was chosen to present in Optum’s Summer 2020 Intern Mini-Series; a series of three presentations over three days where 6 U.S. teams and 3 Ireland teams presented to over 500+ Interns and several executives in the company. That was an awesome experience! I was able to deliver a demo for our product, so I had about half the speaking time in our 10 minute window. There were so many incredible experiences this summer, I’m truly grateful for my time working at Optum.</p>

<h2 id="my-work">My Work:</h2>
<p>Our project was to implement a statistics reporting dashboard for a piece of open source software my supervisors and mentors had developed called Barista. Barista is an open source governance platform. Basically, in order to develop open source software for a large company, it becomes increasingly important to ensure the safety of the packages that you’re using. Barista would scan repositories or folders for licenses, determine what packages are being used, and report back on which of those packages are vulnerable to various issues and whether or not the licenses reported fit into company standards. It’s a really cool application that replaced an enterprise piece of software called Black Duck.</p>

<p>I was able to spearhead the design process for our dashboard. Maybe it was because I was so persistent, or persuasive, but many of my ideas for our dashboard were able to be implemented. Alongside this, I had the fortune of being able to work heavily with the charting library that was being implemented across our site. We had been using a charting library that has since been unsupported, so one of my first tasks was to update it using a more maintained library. Because of this, I was able to engineer how the charts were implemented across our entire site. I did my best to ensure modularity, simplicity, and inheritance of different functionality from a parent class. This was all done in TypeScript, a language that I’d never worked with before. I really enjoyed working with it. I was surprised at how intuitive working with the Angular framework was. Some of my experiments with Rust earlier in the summer were a great help to being able to understand TypeScript’s typing system.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned:</h2>
<p>While I’d consider myself pretty well spoken with a pretty extensive speaking history, my experiences giving business presentations were spectacular. I feel much more confident in being able to give a presentation around technology and selling a product. Past this, I learned a lot of new technologies due to the nature of working with a company. I got much more comfortable with Git and GitHub since I was using it every day. I was primarily using the GitHub desktop app to interact, so my next step is learning all the command line commands. I got more comfortable with HTML and CSS (SCSS) because I took up a lot of the design of our dashboard. I learned a lot about how Angular in particular is able to using traditional classes and functions within HTML in order to create something more dynamic. I also witnessed the frustrations of SCSS and how Angular’s ViewEncapsulation is frustrating when implemeting styles for classes that exist outside your current scope.</p>

<p>I won’t lie, I was immensely surprised at how much of my education carried into my work. Reading on web forums, it always seems that others’ computer science education was of little use when they got started in an enterprise position. I believe that by focusing on the fundamentals and teaching them to others in my TA position, I was able to pick up some of the languages we used a lot faster than I may have otherwise. I’d probably consider myself proficient in TypeScript after that experience, but it wasn’t difficult to grasp because many of their conventions are passed in from languages I’m familiar with. Some syntax akin to the C-like languages, functions and functional program styles that I’ve seen in Python, typing similar to Rust, etc. In my TA work this semester, I’ll be teaching a 1xxx level intro course again, and I really want to focus on patterns and picking up the fundamentals. If I can drill that into my students’ heads I think they’ll be in good shape.</p>

<p>I also was able to learn a lot of technologies that are used in maintaining and creating an actual piece of software. Things that you need in place, but may not be thought about often. We worked frequently with our PostgreSQL database, modifying queries, and gathering data. I also learned more about deploying software using things like GitHub in conjunction with Docker and Jenkins to build and deploy our code. Using those processes was very educational. I wouldn’t consider myself an expert in any regard, but I think I know enough to get started now.</p>

<p>Another thing that really helped out in my internship was my knowledge of *nix environments. All our work was done on MacBooks, so I got to play around with a command line frequently. It helped me do some minor git things that weren’t possible in the desktop app. I saved myself a lot of time through the summer by being smart with my commands. By creating custom bash aliases, I was able to very easily start up all my servers in a few seconds each morning instead of navigating to the folder and running a few commands to actually get it up and running. That’s another thing I’ll be able to bring into my TA work. I’ll have to stress the importance of all these commands when we introduce our students to the command line on our Ubuntu systems.</p>

<p>I just had a really great time. I worked for a company that gave me the sense that I was a valuable asset that they were investing in. That really does help with your own self-value and ultimately, it made me excited to go in to work each day. Alongside that, I was able to work with some incredible people. All three of my supervisors were just incredibly kind, funny, and intelligent individuals that I would be lucky to work for again. All three of my coworkers on the Barista team and the other four coworkers that worked on a different project alongside us were all wonderfully smart, funny people. Work is easy when you can enjoy being with your coworkers like they’re your close friends and also be able to talk to them constructively. There was a lot of trust, and I would fully endorse any of those guys for any of their future endeavors. We were all able to setting into our own roles, and by the end of the summer, we were cranking out code like a well-oiled machine. That’s more of a blessing and a miracle than anything else, but it really was the icing on the cake that was my internship experience.</p>

<p>Thank you Optum. Thanks Randy, Kevin, and Ben. And thank you Kevin, Ryan, and Jorden.</p>

<p>You all made my summer excellent, and I’d love the chance to work with each of you again.</p>
