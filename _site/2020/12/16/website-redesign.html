    <h2 id="why-redesign">Why Redesign?</h2>
<p>So, I’ve just rebuilt the website from the ground up. I had a bit of free time on my hands since I’ve just finished my finals for the semester and figured that this would be a good thing to do in my downtime. Using HTML and SCSS was a big part of my job this summer at Optum, but I haven’t played with it much since, so I wanted to take a crack at it and get some of the rust off.</p>

<p>I was also unhappy with my website. I didn’t really know how it worked, so this was also a learning process. Originally, I had just copied the boilerplate Jekyll code for one the default themes into the site, added some personal descriptions and BAM it worked. That never really sits well with me. I enjoy knowing everything that goes on under the hood. I enjoy customizing things until they’re perfect (or close enough) for me. This was always something I wanted to go back to revise.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s new?</h2>
<p>Well, I’ve changed the navigation and page layout. I now only have the two main pages with the home page and the blog directory. I also have a nicer link to my resume. This is all organized in the sidebar with some nice hover over buttons that link you to the appropriate pages. I’ve also added my social links to the bottom of the sidebar, which makes them a bit more visible.</p>

<p>One of my all time FAVORITE color schemes is <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/">Ethan Schoonover’s Solarized Dark scheme</a>. So, I’ve stolen his colors and have used them as the foundation for my page’s scheme.</p>

<p>I also wanted to reduce on just <strong>how much</strong> of the page was my face. I didn’t tweak the sizing so a lot of the old site was just my noggin. Not the worst view, but also not why you’re probably here.</p>

<h2 id="whats-down-the-pipe">What’s down the pipe?</h2>
<p>Well, immediately, I need to start optimizing this for mobile displays. I also need to sort through my code a bit more and refactor some things. If I actually spend some time learning proper HTML / SCSS then maybe I can make the source code quite a bit nicer, but frankly, it’s not something I’m too interested in. This is a great first step, I can’t wait to start iterating through it a bit more to finalize on a design.</p>
