# About Me:

<img src="/images/carson_TA_article.jpg" alt="me" height="400px" width="400px">

My name is Carson DeSotel, I'm a current sophomore at the University of Minnesota. I'm also a teaching assistant for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. As of posting, this is currently my third semester as a TA and I have taught two different courses (CSCI 1113 and CSCI 1913). 

I'm writing this post as a form of self-introspection and as a way to communicate what I've found success in and what I've found failure in through the past few semesters. This post has been inspired by scholarly articles from lifetime educators who have decades of experience with teaching. In no ways am I equating my experience to theirs, nor am I hoping to appear as an expert on the subject matter. I'd like to present myself as someone who is currently going through all the trials and tribulations of being a teaching assistant. Through this post, I hope to provide solace if you're experiencing similar problems, or maybe ways you could look to improve. 

It's always beneficial to get more knowledge and opinions out into the world. By providing my own experience, I hope to help find answers to questions and methodologies that others may find useful.

Any comments, questions, or concerns can be directed to my email:

# Successes:

<a name="welcome"> </a>
## Welcome to College:
There was a particular student that I had last semester who I particularly enjoyed helping. She was always enthusiastic about the material, and her enjoyment and self fulfillment from coming to a solution with my help made my day. 

I remember in particular the first time we met in lab. She had told me that she was a freshman and was unsure that she was correctly placed into this course, having just come from highschool with the prerequisite couse fulfilled by AP Computer Science. In that moment, I had 2 goals: 
* to reassure her that she was doing okay 
* and to keep her motivated to stay in the course. 

The first thing I did was I said, 
> "First, welcome to the U! We're excited to have you here!" 

I quite like the way I phrased that, it's familiar and inclusive, which I feel would help to ease someone's nerves about being at such a big school. I then talked through her concerns and about her past experiences and identified some of the root causes for this worry. It was *recursion* and a particularly hard lab. That class had a particularly difficult first lab that could have been used to frighten students and prepare them for the road ahead. I did a crash course in recursion for her and helped her come to a solution for the problem. 

### What did she take away from my help?

I reached out to this particular student and asked her about her experience with myself as her teaching assistant. Here's what she had to say:

>I'd be happy to provide some feedback. Overall, I think you are a great TA because you have a natural ability to quickly identify the reason why a student is struggling. A couple of times during the semester, a different TA in the class would answer my questions, but while he gave me an answer, he never helped clarify the concept that I wasn't understanding.
> 
> A stand out moment was when we both happened to be at Saint Anthony Park Library, and you took time out of your weekend to answer a few questions. You probably saved me an hour of drawing incorrect diagrams.
>
> [...] you are one of the rare few comp sci TAs who actually knows how to teach.

The moment she referenced was one where I had passed her in the library while I had been out around campus. I saw that she had been working on a lab and decided to see if I could give her a hand. 

Obviously, not all my interactions with students are this exemplar, but it's very nice to hear such kind words from a student. Often we don't realize the impact we make. 

And while I'm sure there are many TA's who can teach, I do appreciate that she regards my skills so highly.

## It's Just Me:

My first semester teaching I was assigned to an 8-11am lab once a week. I worked with two other TA's and taught a lab of about 40-50 students. One morning, I had received emails from both my coworkers individually that they were sick and would not be able to attend lab. I was on my own.

For those three hours, I flicked back and forth between students, answering questions like some hurricane. It went by extremely fast. This lab was also more intensive with questions and hands being raised, as we had to mark off when they had finished the lab or each section as well. 

The three hours went by, several students thanked me for working so hard, and I left to go about the rest of my day.

This is an example of personal fulfillment for me that I pride myself in doing. I felt that I had done an excellent job and had been an exemplar TA that morning. While I would not wish this on any of my coworkers, it did show me how effective I could be and how much I should cherish my other TA's for sharing the load.

## Crossing the Language Barrier:
Over the course of this semester, I have come to realize that I have a hard time moving past implicit biases, we all do. As humans, we're more likely to gravitate to people similar to us, whether that is physically similar or similar in lifestyle, personality, etc. This becomes a problem when many of the students I teach come from a very different background. I've noticed that when I deal with international students, the gap in the language barrier can cause some problems in class expectations, asking questions, and creating clean code. Because of these problems, I feel that it is easier for *both* parties to become increasingly frustrated if they cannot overcome the language barrier. 

As I interact with some of our Chinese students, of which the computer science department has many, I know that it may take me a second to grasp the core of their questions, and for them to formulate their questions. It's vital to remember to slow down and be thorough. 

### How do you cross the barrier? 
Here are some things to keep in mind that will keep both of you from getting frustrated:

* Draw pictures and let them keep it.
* Take your time. Don't rush to the next person because you're getting flustered.
* Let them think. Coming up with the right questions to ask is hard, coming up with them in another language is worse.
* Read through the problem with them. If you read the problem out loud, it may let you make new decisions and allow them to stop you if they have questions on a specific word or phrase.
* Go over expectations. As instructors, we often have many smaller details we care about, like "Your file must have this naming convention". I've found that many international students will miss this aspect as they get caught up writing the code to submit. Be more clear about addressing these.

## Word Choice:

This is a specific example from last semester (Fall 2019). I had a student email me that he couldn't make it to office hours, but wanted to check in with me about his score for an exam that I graded. I was able to make a time for him and we met up in a public location to talk over his exam. 

Initially, I hadn't given him any points on this question (0/10). This was one of about four questions on the exam, and as such, missing all the points on the question set him back a bit for the rest of the exam. This would be very frustrating already.

Upon meeting him, I talked through the rubric we had been given. I did make a mistake on his exam and was able to give him back 2 points because of my error. Following this, he had tried to argue that he should get all points back. In order to simplify the argument and describe the question, the primary point of the question was to provide 2 constants that satisfied an equation, each constant being worth 4 points. This was specified in the question itself. He had provided an example of the base equation where the constants were represented by variables and said that because there were infinite possiblities for the constants, saying that constants existed in those variables, he should get points. 

While accurate in that he could've picked any number of constants, he had provided me with neither. After going back and forth arguing our points, he tried to get me to meet him halfway in points (as a sort of compromise). With this, I had said the following:

> "I'm sorry, I can't do that. I wish I could do more for you."

To which he responded:

> "No you aren't. Don't lie to me."

I believe he then thanked me for my time and then left. I forget exactly what happened, as I was quite stunned. I thought that this response was wholly unwarrented and unreasonable. I talked to my parents about it, who assured me that he did have the right to say that, and that by saying I was sorry, I assumed a level of familiarity that hadn't been established in the situation.

### Takeaways from the conversation:

* Word choice matters drastically. It matters a lot more when either party is frustrated.
* You need to be aware of your role at any given moment. Are you an authority or a peer? What's the situation?
* Difficult interactions will happen. As an authority, you shouldn't escalate the situation by getting frustrated yourself.

At this point, I had felt upset because I had added him to my schedule. I was upset that he got upset with me during the time I made for him.

As I go forward as a TA, I look back at this experience as a good learning experience. It was one of my more truly difficult situations, and I feel that there are many things to take away from it in terms of being an official and how my relationships with students aren't always as friendly as I try to make them in lab.

How would you have handled this situation? What words would you have chosen?

# Takeaways:

How can I be the best I can be? In order for me to be the best version of myself, I feel that constant observation and re-evaluation of my life and personal goals can help guide me to make the best decsisions possible. 

I also firmly believe that not enough people take the time to take a moment to look at their life. In the digital age, oftentimes our lives are going faster than we would expect, and we're unable to take the time to appreciate each day as it passes.

I'd encourage you to stop and ask yourself if there is anything you can do to make your life more enjoyable for yourself.

## Applications to Being a TA:

To become a better TA, find the areas in which you excel and try to find ways to improve those. Being a TA is a diverse job involving communication, critical thinking, time management, and leadership skills. If you feel that you have a certain area of your position that you are better at, try to make strides in that area. Are you a good communicator? Think of better ways you can get across concepts to your students in lab. Alongside this, by bolstering your weaknesses alongside strengths, you can improve yourself in all walks of life. For example, I wasn't the best at grading, so I looked at why I wasn't: I didn't set aside a specific time to do it. By making a change to my behavior and giving myself a specific time to grade in, I can improve my experience by being able to get more work done. I wouldn't have been able to identify that problem if I hadn't been paying attention to myself.

## Thoughts on Leadership:

I think that there is a specific person that makes a good TA, a good leader, and ultimately a good teacher. They're ruthless people that do whatever they can to help themselves and others advance forward. I feel that some of the best leaders have often asked themselves "What can I do better?" and as a result, they followed a plan and became better for it. You have to be active in your own life, you cannot take a passenger role. In the case of [Word Choice](#words), I wouldn't have learned something from that interaction if I hadn't thought there was something that I could learn to improve from it. By asking people and confronting my weakness, I have learned to be more careful with how I interact with students in the future, and the language and attitude I portray in my different roles.

# Questions and Answers:

*What do you do when everything goes wrong?*

The first thing to do when 'everything' goes wrong is to acknowledge that you don't know why it's going wrong. I've found that being honest with students usually leads to better interactions. You're not a TA because you have an encyclopedic knowledge of Python, you're a TA because of your ability to communicate concepts and problem solve. Showing your students that ability will go further for you and them than struggling through a half-baked answer.

*How can I help someone when I don't know exactly how to help?*

Start with what their problem is. Ask very clear, targeted questions to try and outline the problem. From there do debugging, either literally or figuratively based on your circumstances. I typically look over their assignment or lab handout alongside them and verbally walk through it with them. It helps me get a sense of what may be going on. Talking through each line of their code or assignment could also be a good strategy. Sometimes the computer misses a small problem in syntax or the student will make a small error that isn't obvious on a macro scale. 

> ex. if you're in an entry C++ course and a student accidentally uses a & bitwise operator instead of the && comparison operator, it would be hard for them to diagnose and for the computer to pick up on.

*Should I be a friend or an authority?*

Yes.

Draw the line in the sand where you see fit. I enjoy being amicable to my students, so I make more friendships with them. I enjoy recognizing them in classes or around campus, it makes for a more inclusive department all-in-all. The line in the sand is that I realize their my students, I'm not asking them to hang out or meet up for coffee. 

The administrative side comes up where I don't play favorites or grade on a bias for students I like. Sure, there are students I have more of a connection with than others, but they are all treated fairly in grading. 

*Would I be a good TA?*

The people that I believe make the best TA's are self-motivated and driven to help others. If you have a strong sense of satisfaction from seeing others succeed, then I would suggest it. If you want to get more comfortable with a certain set of material, then I would suggest it. I definitely learn something new each semester I teach.
