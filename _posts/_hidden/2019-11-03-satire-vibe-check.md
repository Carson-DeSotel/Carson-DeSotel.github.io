# University of Minnesota student passes out free "vibe checks" in front of DP Dough
Entrepeneur and University junior, Joseph "Big Dog" Schwartzman, has recently begun a venture to assist his fellow classmates.

"It's easy," said Big Dog when we asked about his buisiness, "Thursday and Friday night, I'm standing outside DP Dough waiting for someone who just looks like they need to be vibe checked, y'know." When asking about what this "vibe check" could mean, he looked at me blankly for a second, shrugged, and punched me square in the stomach. As I was doubled over, reeling in agony from Big Dog's raw, powerful punch, I had a distinct moment of clarity. It was the case that I hadn't been vibing this whole time. Big Dog was able to help me back to my feet as I grasped him firmly into an embrace as a thanks for him checking my vibe.

"You can tell instantly if you're vibing or not," Big Dog says whilst throwing a punch at another University Student, "it's the people who are truly vibing that are the real heroes. Sometimes, I'll come in with the vibe check and they won't go down."

Fellow student, Ajay Thakur, was one of such students. 

"I'm jus tryna get som Doughh. Havn eatn all dayyyyyyy," Ajay said, stumbling around. 

Big Dog went into DP Dough with Ajay, ordered him a Rolling Rock 'Zone with a plastic cup of water, sat him down and wished him a good night.

"It's the least I can do for the guy, he's gonna need some help later."

"Y'know, it's not about losing the money for me, I have the Hooked app, so I'm able to get some pretty decent deals. Is it fine if I drop my referral code here? No? Anyways, between that and how nice it makes me feel, I consider the cost of passing a vibe check to be very minimal.

As we thanked Big Dog for his time, he smiled, waved, and cracked his fists menacingly towards us, in that order. It's not always easy doing things for others, but I'm glad that we have some young folks who are still willing to take the initiative and provide necessary services without a benefit for themselves. We hope that Big Dog and any other student like him the best of luck. 

# Coming Next
