This is a test to see how well the Spotify integration works. 
This playlist, called 'soda fountain', is a playlist that I made today. The theme is very light pop, that seems very dreamy. I was heavily inspired by Jack Stauber's style and wanted to find similar artists / styles to his. None are exactly the same, but we get pretty close. Enjoy the playlist if you're interested!
