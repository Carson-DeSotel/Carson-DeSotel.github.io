How do I view the inequality situation in America? What do I believe needs to change?

# Where I Stand

My name's Carson. I'm white. I'm furious about the events that have transpired around my home and school in Minneapolis. I'm furstrated that it had to come to this for black voices to once again be heard in America. Regardless, I am hopefull that my generation will be the ones to push for better social policies to benefit us all. I want to make this known to add more discourse to the conversation. To show that this whole problem goes deeper than the police. To show that during my education, I took a couple things away about inequality and its racist origins. 

I hope it doesn't sound like pandering. I hope that this is another voice of support and more importantly, a resolution to act where I can.

My heart is with you in Minneapolis and across our country.

I'm sorry to say that I'm not doing more, that I'm not out in protests, that I'm not helping to clean up the street, that I'm not screaming my lungs out to push for change. I'm sorry that I'm scared right now. I'm sorry that the fear I now feel about the streets, about the police is something that black families and communities have been struggling since this country's inception. I want to say that I get it, that I understand the depth of your problems, but I'm afraid that I don't know that I ever will. I, nor anyone in my family, has been a victim of racial discrimination, of the acts of racist individuals, of militant policing. That's not something to sorry of, that's something to be aware of is a cause of white privilege and to continue to strive so that each of my friends, the members of my community, and all people of color across our country are not affected by that in the future.

The use of **our** country is intentional. White supremacists will tell people of color that they don't belong here. That this is a country that is A) white and B) speaks English. Fuck them. Our country is diverse, many people speak multiple languages, many are not white; and through that, our country becomes stronger. In elementary school, when learning about American history, I was never proud of the wars. I was proud of the "cultural mixing pot" that we had been since the beginning. Unfortunately, that pot was usually European flavored. 

It is my wish that my children, or those in their generation can go to school to learn about what makes America a wonderful nation -- the people of diverse backgrounds, of people from each continent, our support for those in need like we're seeing in times like these, and the ability to seek personal freedom. HOWEVER, I also want them to see the horrors -- the unfair history of slavery, the use of politics to marginalize and resist the freedom of our people of color, the horrible treatment of those from the Middle East and Central America, our treatment of the LGBTQ+ and transgender communities, the way we idolize a small percentage of the "talented" but suppress those same talents in the individuals who weren't raised into money, our treatment of drug addicts, our treatment of prisoners being that of pain and not rehabilitation. Should I go on? There'd be too much to write.

# Racial Inequality, as American as Apple Pie

I'm nearly pressed to say that police are a cause and not a symptom, what's stopping me is a lack of appropriate background, and the thought that the statement subtracts from the protests currently going on. However, I am going to say that when we solve and control the police force, we are not yet done with rebalancing our equality in America. There are many more systems that have long been in place that have prevented the success of people of color, and have given rise to many to become racist individuals. 

During my geography education, we've discussed racial inequality as a geographic problem, in some sense. Why? Many of the systems that are in place have forced it to become a geography-considered issue and not just a social or ethics issue. Let's take the case of [*redlining*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20redlining,the%20selective%20raising%20of%20prices.) where those in power further marginalized black communities on racist pretenses. Through a cursory read of the Wikipedia page provided (provided as to show more sources and to give a concise summary more beneficial than an article on the topic), one can realize how the fundamental use of this was to provide a real-world outlet for racist beliefs and to futher supress the rights of black communities. This system further marginalized and reinforced racist beliefs through "facts and statistics" that measured the ability of certain communities to pay back loans and effectively own housing. Some causes for that belief could stem with the thought that members of a black community would have lower-income jobs, but doesn't that stem from racist beliefs that forced them out of applying to more "white-collar" jobs and from achieving in higher education. We can see that in the cases of [James Meredith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Meredith) and [Vivian Malone Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Malone_Jones) among many others. When attempting to rise against a white society, they were met with great resistance only on the basis of the color of their skin. How many had tried and failed to attend a college before them? How many now are unable to attend college due to rising costs of living and a minimum wage that forces them into an unbreakable cycle without extremely hard work? 

Why should college be a choice, a *right* for me, but an opportunity that only comes through extreme circumstances for people of color?

When the system has been stacked against you for centuries, at some point you have to recognize that it's intentional. That it is through outside, white inteferance that constantly keeps our people of color in that place. Hence, I would like to recognize that in the wake of reducing and moving to solve police violence, we initiate a large scale reform on education and politics. Through education, both in reform of content and funding, we can educate the next generation to fight and recognize the injustices placed upon our citizens for centuries. We can teach them how to be more empathetic, to rise against the teachings of parents who don't know any better, and to fight against an unfair system. We need to celebrate African culture and heritage, not destroy it. We need to become more inclusive and not assimilative. 

There must also be steps to solve governmental problems including [gerrymadering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering), and the further marginalization of colored communities. There have likely been many governmental policies that have inequaly benefitted those in need that should be dismantled. 

The inequality in America today and since 1776 shouldn't be seen as solely perpetuated by police, but also as a system set in place by centuries of racist beliefs and ideologies brought into place in all facets of our government today. How can a system set in place that long ago, by those who owned slaves still be completely infalliable to this day? Some are going to see that statement as akin to me pissing on our flag, but don't see the irony in disrespecting it with their own U.S. Flag merchandise that they constantly parade. 

Our country is a symbol of those who fought against a monarch who ruled on people who he had no possible idea as to what their country looked like. I'm sorry to say that those in Washington D.C. are living through a situation that mimics the foundation of our country, and unfortunately for them, they're not on the side they want to be on. 

# In the End

Thank you for reading. Most of this piece comes from my heart and personal beliefs, and thus if I don't have all the surrounding knowledge about the Black Lives Matter movement, the history of people of color in America, and what is currently being done, please email me at carson.desotel@gmail.com to help me improve my claim. 

I'd also like to say that I've made a donation to the [Reclaim the Block](https://www.reclaimtheblock.org/home) organization so that they can push for preventative and proactive measures to crime in the Twin Cities areas such as funding for things that directly impact and improve the lives of our communities.
