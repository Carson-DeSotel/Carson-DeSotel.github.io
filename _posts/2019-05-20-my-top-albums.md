###My Top Albums

#Why? 
Because why not? This is more for me than the general public. I thought it would be interesting to post some of my favorite albums now and then come back in a few years to see where I stand. 

#How did I decide?
Only a handful or two of these albums I've actually listened to all the way. Those albums were the first I thought of, and will be fawned over in my discussion about said album. A lot of these albums are serious pieces of work, more classical definitions of art, however a choice few are also here because I think they are a hilarious and unique representation of art in the medium. I went throught the Spotify playlists that I've made over the past four years and compiled some of my most memorable and favorite albums from artists featured prominently in my playlists. 

*NOTE: Sometimes an album is here for the representation of an artist as some of their most influential and seminal pieces. My inclusion of said work may only be a stand in for the artist themself, and if so, it will be noted in the discussion.*
