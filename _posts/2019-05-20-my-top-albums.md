## Why? 
Because why not? This is more for me than the general public. I thought it would be interesting to post some of my favorite albums now and then come back in a few years to see where I stand. 

## How did I decide?
Only a handful or two of these albums I've actually listened to all the way. Those albums were the first I thought of, and will be fawned over in my discussion about said album. A lot of these albums are serious pieces of work, more classical definitions of art, however a choice few are also here because I think they are a hilarious and unique representation of art in the medium. I went throught the Spotify playlists that I've made over the past four years and compiled some of my most memorable and favorite albums from artists featured prominently in my playlists. 

*NOTE: Sometimes an album is here for the representation of an artist as some of their most influential and seminal pieces. My inclusion of said work may only be a stand in for the artist themself, and if so, it will be noted in the discussion.*

### Row One
![Row One](/images/favoriteAlbums/row1.png)

This row is all about synth, techno, and some more electronic inspired music. King Gizzard is the outlier in this row, but I feel that *Nonagon Infinity* has a similar flavor to some of the albums (i.e. *Leather Teeth, Redline*)

To start, one of my absolute favorite bands: TWRP. TWRP is a group of interstellar, time-travelling, rocking dudes who are from the future and also the 80's. Their two most recent albums, *Together Through Time* and *Ladyworld* are shown here. I've been keeping up with TWRP since aroun 2015 where I found them through Ninja Sex Party, who they frequently do background work on songs and collaboration for. Since then, I've seen their style develop from very synthesizer-heavy and electro-centric to a clean mix of funk, rhythm, and a more diluted synthesizer overall. Members from the band have seen success in their own solo projects (see Doctor Sung's *Groove Crusader* EP and Lord Phobos' *Phobos I*). Enough gushing. I love these albums because of the heavy focus on sentimental and sometimes sensual lyrics and the excellent instrumentation provided by bassist Commander Meouch in particular. The band flows easily with eachother and creates a seamless blend of popping and slapping bass riffs to guitar solos with a perpetual and instricate layer of percussion driving the albums by at a quick pace. See "Our 4fathers" and "Take Care of U" from *Together Through Time* for examples of some of that beautiful instrumentation. I love *Ladyworld* because it contradicts some things we've seen about the band. With collaboration with the highly-sexual Ninja Sex Party and creating the hit "The No Pants Dance" (seen on *The Device*, later redone with NSP), Ladyworld contradicts that particular mindset and themes with songs like "R.E.S.P.E.C.T Her" and *Body Image* which go off of conservation and having a positive self-image. "Body Image" is probably one of my favorite songs of the band. It has such a wonderful message and the instrumentation is so precise and catchy, **everyone** should listen to this song.

Daft Punk's *Musique Vol. 1* is just a classic. It contains a large amount of the duo's most iconic and popular songs. I've listened to it multiple times through. Daft Punk is such a large influence in the electronic and synth scence, and I feel bad saying that they're probably my second favorite costumed-synth-band-from-a-country-with-native-French-speakers (TWRP hailing from the great white north of Canada). Daft Punk is the kind of electronic I could listen to with my parents. Granted, this album has one of my absolute songs in "Something About Us". It's a beautiful and soft love song that melts me away each time I hear it. The soft backing tracks and the endearing vocals and beautiful piano solo make this piece just perfect. I listen to it each time I see the name pop up on a playlist. Besides that, the other songs that stand out to me the most are "Around the World", "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" (sans Kanye), and "Digital Love". A solid album easily. Personally, not a lot of stand out pieces that I would put in any playlist that's not Daft Punk-centric. I listen to the album iteself at about the same frequency as I listen to the songs.

*Leather Teeth* by Carpenter Brut is an incredible hard-electronic album. It has a very powerful "instrumentation" that creates a lot of moving parts to keep track of while listening to the album. The first time I listened to the title track "Leather Teeth" it sent chills down my back; I love listening to the slow build up to the power drop that kicks off the album. This is a go-to pump up album for me. Because the album only has 8 songs, I'll usually just listen through it all in one go. It's an incredibly empowering album solely based on the amount of energy carried in the songs. Stand out songs for me are "Leather Teeth" and "Hairspray Hurricane".

*Redline* by Lazerhawk is an album that I've known of since around 2016. TWRP really kicked open the door on synth for me (see *The Device* for a more synth-based album). Shortly afterwards I found this album (the means are lost on me). It's a short and powerful album that I believe is perfect for driving. You know those albums that make you go, "I want to drive my car...at night...while wearing sunglasses and leather gloves", because this is that album. It's been a while since I've really listened to it, but it'll probably be included on this list for the forseeable future. Occasionally I'll visit [r/outrun](www.reddit.com/r/outrun) on Reddit and will look around for album or artist suggestions. *Redline* is consistently on those lists. It's an absolute joy to listen to. Usually the songs just blur together for me, because I'll usually leave the album going if I rediscover it. Stand out's on this one are probably "Electric Groove", "Dream Machine", and "Pedal to the Metal" but really, this whole album is a gem.

*Nonagon Infinity* is an album that I've only really started listening to recently. I've been aware of King Gizz for a year or two now, but only in the past month have I started doing a dive into their music. They just produce *so much* of it. I mean they've been around for eight years, and have about thirteen albums. It's absolutely insane. What's even worse is that each album has a bit of it's own flavor going from folk to true psychadelic-rock which is what I was interested in. *Nonagon Infinity* is seen as one of their better albums, and frankly it's just super well made and catchy. The album has nine songs (for each vertex on a nonagon) and the final song loops back into the first song wonderfully (thus, infinity). It's incredible that I've had ***Nonagon Infinity opens the door*** stuck in my head on loop for about a week now. It's rediculously catchy and a unique listening experience with instrumentation only available with the band's unique cast (starring two drummers and about nine other people). It's incredible. "Robot Stop" and "Gamma Knife" are my favorite tracks off this album. 

And that's it for the first row. My love for synth, electronic beats, and experiemental instrumentation comes from a love of the rhythm and beat itself. I think that's a general trend among my music. Typically the lyrics of a song don't really resonate as much with me, but an intricate beat and overlapping instrumentations are just delightful.

### Row Two
![Row Two](/images/favoriteAlbums/row2.png)

Here's where a lot of my more *mainstream* pop preferences lie. Recently I've been finding myself more interested in a genre called "bedroom pop" (as dubbed by Spotify). If you want to check it out, [here's](/2019/05/18/spotify-test.html) an example of a playlist I recently made that features a similar style.

The first album in this row is *Californication* by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This is my favorite RHCP album, I think that it got the most playtime from me between itself, *Blood Sugar Sex Magik* and *By the Way*. RHCP will probably be one of my favorite bands for the majority of my life. I love their sound, primarily because I love the funky, slappy bass licks that Flea puts down. I haven't listened to this whole album through and through, but have picked out songs I liked and added them to plenty of playlists over my lifetime. Top songs for me would be "Otherside", "Scar Tissue", and "Road Trippin'". Good album, will always make me nostalgic. Each time I listen to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, it brings me back to the third grade when my teacher would occasionally put on "Under the Bridge" from *Blood Sugar Sex Magik* (and also "Du Hast" by Rammstein). She was awesome.

Grouplove is excellent. I started to listen to them around the same time I was getting really into RHCP, The White Stripes, Cage the Elephant, the Strokes, and other similar Alt Rock / Pop bands. They were also one of the first concerts I went to. They were performing around Minneapolis in 2014 (?), when my mom took me and my family to a performance they were having at the Chipotle Cultivate Festival. I want to say I was already listening to them by that time. They started the show by saying "There's two things you have to remember: one, cultivate and two, SMOKE WEED!" I have never seen my mom so shocked and mortified. It's one of our favorite memories. This album has a lot of great songs on it. My favorite from that performance was "Shark Attack". Between that, "Borderlines and Aliens", "Ways to Go", "Schoolboy", "Hippy Hill", and "Raspberry", this album contains some really great songs. They aren't a band I listen to often, but something about them makes me feel giddy, nostalgic, and gives me the urge to dance. I would easily recommend this album to anyone.

*AM* by the Arctic Monkeys. This is another band that got lumped into the previous two in that same period of my life. I found them and a lot of music that I've discussed a bit from the "Cage the Elephant radio" on iHeartRadio. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Arctic Monkeys has a really cool sound that draws me in. Some of my favorite songs of theirs' that's not on this album are "Teddypicker" and "Brianstorm". I think something that I really like about their music is that they retain some sense of intimacy and truth to them. Like in "Knee Socks" with the line "with your coughdrop colored tounge", or the entirety of "Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?", I just get sucked into what feels like a really personal recollection of true events. Getting sucked into the smallest details of whatever past girl it's written for. Again, I would recommend this whole album. If I had to give specific song recommendations, I'd give you "Do I Wanna Know?", "Snap Out Of It", and "I Want It All". I chose this album, because I think it's one of the best examples of their work, but I would check out *Favourite Worst Nightmare* for songs like "Old Yellow Bricks", "505" and the songs I mentioned earlier.

*Currents* by Tame Impala is a pretty recent adition to this list. I'd head their stuff before, but got into them more after I dove deeper into King Gizzard. *Currents* is a pretty basic album, in the sense that you could play it at a party and you'd probably get some pretty happy reactions from people there. It's still on my listen to it all the way list, but the musical style just resonates with me so easily that I had to include it already. Top hits from this album are going to be "Let It Happen", "Eventually", and "The Less I Know The Better".

*Pop Food* and Jack Stauber are also pretty new additions to my favorites. One of my friends introduced me to him, and I'd seen some of his animations on YouTube before. It's a kind of music that can make you feel good even if you don't know what's going on. I'd be lying if I said I knew all the words to "Buttercup", but it's still a great song that makes me get the warm and fuzzies. He's a great artist, in his song writing talents, but also in the way he uses physical media and videos to better represent some of the songs' abstract natures. "Buttercup" and "Oh Klahoma" are going to be my top picks. 

*Honey* by Robyn is a great album and I think I'm the only one that cares! It has a pretty similar feel to Jack Stauber, in its more trance-like and slow-ish beats. I haven't heard anyone mention anything off this album. And I only found it because I got a bit sick and wandered around campus before finals last Fall. I turned on a Spotify-curated Indie playlist, and I believe the song I head was "Because It's In The Music". Why should you care about *Honey*? I'd recommend it if you like some intimacy in vocals, and some catchy and clean backing tracks. "Between The Lines" has a really catchy backing track between the piano, drum machine, and the interesting other sounds that are thrown in for flavor. It also plays with stereo channeling, having some sounds only on the left side of the headphones, which makes it an even more interesting sonic experience.

### Row Three
![Row Three](/images/favoriteAlbums/row3.png)

Rap is something I don't listen to often. Mainly because of the way I digest music. I will usually listen to certain genres during specific times of the year, instead of listening to one genre for the whole thing. It keeps it fresh and lets me experience different moods that change with the weather, which I think is pretty neat. Rap follows Jazz for me. Usually I get back into the two in the late fall and carry it with me as the trees lose their leaves and winter starts to chill my bones. I think I also like listening to this stuff when school's around also let's me keep my brain trained a bit more. Jazz has some incredible stuff musically that I can sit and analyze, and rap has some really complex and intricate lyrics and beat patterns that keep me interested for similar reasons. I'm pretty picky about the rap I listen to though. I like to have more of an older, classic rap. I think New York rap is where I reside more in. More Biggie than 2Pac. 

Mos Def is first up on this row, with his album *Black On Both Sides*. This is another example of an album here for representation of an artist. I've really only listened to "Mathematics" and "Ms. Fat Booty" extensively from Mos Def, but they are really great tunes. Listening to the album from the beginning, with "Fear Not Of Man", gives me all the reason I need to include the album on the list. It's what I like about rap and hip hop; you have a really intricate and interesting backing track with really cool layers, he doesn't come out hot right away, but tries to talk and speak his mind. When the rap does finally come in, it's calm, impactful and leads right in from the beat and the speech before hand. The song also leads right into "Hip Hop" and keeps up the same powerful energy that was built up before it. Top picks off this album are "Ms. Fat Booty", "Mathematics", and "Hip Hop" for me.

### Row Four
![Row Four](/images/favoriteAlbums/row4.png)

This is where my classic rock lives. Some of my top-five albums, *Gaucho* and *Aja* live here.

### Row Five
![Row Five](/images/favoriteAlbums/row5.png)

This row is a cluster. We have metal, a video game soundtrack, parody albums, and some good ol' 90's pop. This is one where I wanted to fit a lot in, because I couldn't justify 3 more rows of similar artists.

### Row Six
![Row Six](/images/favoriteAlbums/row6.png)

Back to some classic jazz tunes. Jazz has been really important to me for a long time now, and I always try to have a jazz playlist in the rotation, just in case I have the right mood for it. I played in my high school's Jazz Band, so I took a lot of inspiration from songs that we played there.
