# My Top Albums

## Why? 
Because why not? This is more for me than the general public. I thought it would be interesting to post some of my favorite albums now and then come back in a few years to see where I stand. 

## How did I decide?
Only a handful or two of these albums I've actually listened to all the way. Those albums were the first I thought of, and will be fawned over in my discussion about said album. A lot of these albums are serious pieces of work, more classical definitions of art, however a choice few are also here because I think they are a hilarious and unique representation of art in the medium. I went throught the Spotify playlists that I've made over the past four years and compiled some of my most memorable and favorite albums from artists featured prominently in my playlists. 

*NOTE: Sometimes an album is here for the representation of an artist as some of their most influential and seminal pieces. My inclusion of said work may only be a stand in for the artist themself, and if so, it will be noted in the discussion.*

### Row One

This row is all about synth, techno, and some more electronic inspired music. King Gizzard is the outlier in this row, but I feel that *Nonagon Infinity* has a similar flavor to some of the albums (i.e. *Leather Teeth, Redline*)

### Row Two

Here's where a lot of my more *mainstream* pop preferences lie. Recently I've been finding myself more interested in a genre called "bedroom pop" (as dubbed by Spotify). If you want to check it out, [here's](/2019/05/18/spotify-test.md) an example of a playlist I recently made that features a similar style.

### Row Three

This is my rap. I really love the more old-school, New York kind of rap. I felt that MF DOOM (ALL CAPS when you spell the man name) has been able to kepp that spirit alive into the modern trap and mumble era. 

### Row Four

This is where my classic rock lives. Some of my top-five albums, *Gaucho* and *Aja* live here.

### Row Five

This row is a cluster. We have metal, a video game soundtrack, parody albums, and some good ol' 90's pop. This is one where I wanted to fit a lot in, because I couldn't justify 3 more rows of similar artists.

### Row Six

Back to some classic jazz tunes. Jazz has been really important to me for a long time now, and I always try to have a jazz playlist in the rotation, just in case I have the right mood for it. I played in my high school's Jazz Band, so I took a lot of inspiration from songs that we played there.
