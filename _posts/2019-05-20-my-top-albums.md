## Why? 
Because why not? This is more for me than the general public. I thought it would be interesting to post some of my favorite albums now and then come back in a few years to see where I stand. 

## How did I decide?
Only a handful or two of these albums I've actually listened to all the way. Those albums were the first I thought of, and will be fawned over in my discussion about said album. A lot of these albums are serious pieces of work, more classical definitions of art, however a choice few are also here because I think they are a hilarious and unique representation of art in the medium. I went throught the Spotify playlists that I've made over the past four years and compiled some of my most memorable and favorite albums from artists featured prominently in my playlists. 

*NOTE: Sometimes an album is here for the representation of an artist as some of their most influential and seminal pieces. My inclusion of said work may only be a stand in for the artist themself, and if so, it will be noted in the discussion.*

### Row One
![Row One](/images/favoriteAlbums/row1.png)

This row is all about synth, techno, and some more electronic inspired music. King Gizzard is the outlier in this row, but I feel that *Nonagon Infinity* has a similar flavor to some of the albums (i.e. *Leather Teeth, Redline*)

To start, one of my absolute favorite bands: TWRP. TWRP is a group of interstellar, time-travelling, rocking dudes who are from the future and also the 80's. Their two most recent albums, *Together Through Time* and *Ladyworld* are shown here. I've been keeping up with TWRP since aroun 2015 where I found them through Ninja Sex Party, who they frequently do background work on songs and collaboration for. Since then, I've seen their style develop from very synthesizer-heavy and electro-centric to a clean mix of funk, rhythm, and a more diluted synthesizer overall. Members from the band have seen success in their own solo projects (see Doctor Sung's *Groove Crusader* EP and Lord Phobos' *Phobos I*). Enough gushing. I love these albums because of the heavy focus on sentimental and sometimes sensual lyrics and the excellent instrumentation provided by bassist Commander Meouch in particular. The band flows easily with eachother and creates a seamless blend of popping and slapping bass riffs to guitar solos with a perpetual and instricate layer of percussion driving the albums by at a quick pace. See "Our 4fathers" and "Take Care of U" from *Together Through Time* for examples of some of that beautiful instrumentation. I love *Ladyworld* because it contradicts some things we've seen about the band. With collaboration with the highly-sexual Ninja Sex Party and creating the hit "The No Pants Dance" (seen on *The Device*, later redone with NSP), Ladyworld contradicts that particular mindset and themes with songs like "R.E.S.P.E.C.T Her" and *Body Image* which go off of conservation and having a positive self-image. "Body Image" is probably one of my favorite songs of the band. It has such a wonderful message and the instrumentation is so precise and catchy, **everyone** should listen to this song.

Daft Punk's *Musique Vol. 1* is just a classic. It contains a large amount of the duo's most iconic and popular songs. I've listened to it multiple times through. Daft Punk is such a large influence in the electronic and synth scence, and I feel bad saying that they're probably my second favorite costumed-synth-band-from-a-country-with-native-French-speakers (TWRP hailing from the great white north of Canada). Daft Punk is the kind of electronic I could listen to with my parents. Granted, this album has one of my absolute songs in "Something About Us". It's a beautiful and soft love song that melts me away each time I hear it. The soft backing tracks and the endearing vocals and beautiful piano solo make this piece just perfect. I listen to it each time I see the name pop up on a playlist. Besides that, the other songs that stand out to me the most are "Around the World", "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" (sans Kanye), and "Digital Love". A solid album easily. Personally, not a lot of stand out pieces that I would put in any playlist that's not Daft Punk-centric. I listen to the album iteself at about the same frequency as I listen to the songs.

*Leather Teeth* by Carpenter Brut is an incredible hard-electronic album. It has a very powerful "instrumentation" that creates a lot of moving parts to keep track of while listening to the album. The first time I listened to the title track "Leather Teeth" it sent chills down my back; I love listening to the slow build up to the power drop that kicks off the album. This is a go-to pump up album for me. Because the album only has 8 songs, I'll usually just listen through it all in one go. It's an incredibly empowering album solely based on the amount of energy carried in the songs. Stand out songs for me are "Leather Teeth" and "Hairspray Hurricane".

*Redline* by Lazerhawk is an album that I've known of since around 2016. TWRP really kicked open the door on synth for me (see *The Device* for a more synth-based album). Shortly afterwards I found this album (the means are lost on me). It's a short and powerful album that I believe is perfect for driving. You know those albums that make you go, "I want to drive my car...at night...while wearing sunglasses and leather gloves", because this is that album. It's been a while since I've really listened to it, but it'll probably be included on this list for the forseeable future. Occasionally I'll visit [r/outrun](www.reddit.com/r/outrun) on Reddit and will look around for album or artist suggestions. *Redline* is consistently on those lists. It's an absolute joy to listen to. Usually the songs just blur together for me, because I'll usually leave the album going if I rediscover it. Stand out's on this one are probably "Electric Groove", "Dream Machine", and "Pedal to the Metal" but really, this whole album is a gem.

*Nonagon Infinity* is an album that I've only really started listening to recently. I've been aware of King Gizz for a year or two now, but only in the past month have I started doing a dive into their music. They just produce *so much* of it. I mean they've been around for eight years, and have about thirteen albums. It's absolutely insane. What's even worse is that each album has a bit of it's own flavor going from folk to true psychadelic-rock which is what I was interested in. *Nonagon Infinity* is seen as one of their better albums, and frankly it's just super well made and catchy. The album has nine songs (for each vertex on a nonagon) and the final song loops back into the first song wonderfully (thus, infinity). It's incredible that I've had ***Nonagon Infinity opens the door*** stuck in my head on loop for about a week now. It's rediculously catchy and a unique listening experience with instrumentation only available with the band's unique cast (starring two drummers and about nine other people). It's incredible. "Robot Stop" and "Gamma Knife" are my favorite tracks off this album. 

And that's it for the first row. My love for synth, electronic beats, and experiemental instrumentation comes from a love of the rhythm and beat itself. I think that's a general trend among my music. Typically the lyrics of a song don't really resonate as much with me, but an intricate beat and overlapping instrumentations are just delightful.

### Row Two

Here's where a lot of my more *mainstream* pop preferences lie. Recently I've been finding myself more interested in a genre called "bedroom pop" (as dubbed by Spotify). If you want to check it out, [here's](/2019/05/18/spotify-test.html) an example of a playlist I recently made that features a similar style.

### Row Three
![Row Three](/images/favoriteAlbums/row3.png)

This is my rap. I really love the more old-school, New York kind of rap. I felt that MF DOOM (ALL CAPS when you spell the man name) has been able to kepp that spirit alive into the modern trap and mumble era. 

### Row Four
![Row Four](/images/favoriteAlbums/row4.png)

This is where my classic rock lives. Some of my top-five albums, *Gaucho* and *Aja* live here.

### Row Five
![Row Five](/images/favoriteAlbums/row5.png)

This row is a cluster. We have metal, a video game soundtrack, parody albums, and some good ol' 90's pop. This is one where I wanted to fit a lot in, because I couldn't justify 3 more rows of similar artists.

### Row Six
![Row Six](/images/favoriteAlbums/row6.png)

Back to some classic jazz tunes. Jazz has been really important to me for a long time now, and I always try to have a jazz playlist in the rotation, just in case I have the right mood for it. I played in my high school's Jazz Band, so I took a lot of inspiration from songs that we played there.
