How do you make the most out of your summer vacation in regards to fun and productivity?

# My Summer:

This week marks the first week of my summer vacation! My sophomore year at the University of Minnesota has come to a wrap, and I have a lengthy summer vacation of one month before I have to go to work again. Yes, it'll be a lengthy break indeed. Thankfully, in the midst of all this COVID-19 pandemonium, I've been able to retain my internship offer for this summer. I'm grateful and excited to start. However, I still have a few weeks before it starts up, so what should I be doing?

# Productivity:

I believe the more interesting aspect of this is that I'm still pushing myself to do *some* work. Not a lot, but I don't want to stagnate before my internship, and I want to spend some time improving myself and making some good habits before I have to be a productive member for a company. I didn't have many programming heavy courses this semester (or next semester even), so I'm trying to keep honing that blade in a plateau of my computer science career. I'm taking on some smaller projects (ones that I'll hopefully be able to make more posts about here soon) that tackle some of my interests and allow me to implement some of the topics I learned about last semester. Last semester I took a Algorithms and Data Structures course that was taught using *Introduction to Algorithms* (Cormen *et al*). If you are familiar with this book, you would know that it is done completely in **pseudocode**. Unfortunately for me, nobody in the real world uses pseudocode as a programming language, so I want to implement some of the algorithms and data structures I learned in a more *applicable* language: C++. Again, unfortunately for me, I have never taken a course dealing with data structures in C++ (I have taken and taught one in Java though). Based on my experiences as a TA and how comfortable I've gotten with data structures in Java, implementing them into C++ has been the cause of many headaches. 

Pointers are the bane of my existence. Templates are the eagles picking out my liver like a modern-day Prometheus. And my development environment is the boulder that I push up the hill *Ã  la* Sisyphus. It seems each time I compile my code, I encounter countless syntax errors regarding class tags, or the horrible syntax around template classes. 

Regardless of these problems, I still try to solve them in C++, pulling a little bit of my hair out each time. Granted, the breaks in between coding sessions becomes a little longer each time I fail. This becomes more frustrating when I can write accurate, presentable code in Java with relative ease, but the translation to pointers forces me to shoot my own foot. And even with theses hardships, I can't complain, because I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing -- learning. So, even though I'm frustrated, I'll keep on keeping on and will get something good to happen.

My current workflow through all this is using Visual Studio Code as a text editor and then using the Ubuntu subsystem for Windows for my terminal. I outline some stuff in a journal and then make all my files, go through the necessary functions, and overextend leading to compile errors. If I were to do this differently, I'd probably start with smaller segments and then go more in depth. I think I know exactly what I'm doing and that usually leads me to overextending and then not getting the correct answer.

# Fun:

Fun is important too! I've been really enjoying playing video games like Persona 5: Royal, Doom Eternal, and Terraria most recently. I've been listening to a lot of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard albums. I've also been doing a lot of writing; I just got some new fountain pen materials today. I started sketching images, working on an upcoming D&D campaign, and learning to draw fantasy maps. It's a lot, but why not? That's honestly not even all of it.

If you're in this kind of situation too, I urge you to continue with your passions and hobbies. I feel a lot of my peers worry too much about advancing and getting ahead and not worrying enough about the day-to-day, the fun that surrounds being alive. Don't be a drone and live a little!

# Blog Updates:

I hope to continue using the blog and to continue updating my GitHub over the summer with cool things I do and work on. Next semester, we'll probably see a lot of GIS projects on there, and I may see if I can get ArcGIS set up on my computer with a liscence from the University. I may also be posting more UNIX / Bash things on GitHub, as I'd like to buy a new laptop and load it up with some Linux distro (debating going for Arch or sticking to something safer like Manjaro or maybe going for something like Debian). I think one of my main concerns with Linux distros is what package manager they use. Personally, I like using apt-get over something like pacman. *pacman* just seems silly to me for whatever reason.

Anyways, if you're reading this, thank you. I hope to keep up the good work.
