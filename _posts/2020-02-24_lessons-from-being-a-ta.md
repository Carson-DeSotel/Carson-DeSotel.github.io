# About Me:

<img src="_images/carson_TA_article.jpg" alt="me" height="250" width="250" class="center">

Heya!

My name is Carson DeSotel, I'm a current sophomore at the University of Minnesota. I'm also a teaching assistant for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. As of posting, this is currently my third semester as a TA and I have taught two different courses (CSCI 1113 and CSCI 1913). 

I'm writing this post as a form of self-introspection and as a way to communicate what I've found success in and what I've found failure in through the past few semesters. This post has been inspired by scholarly articles from lifetime educators who have decades of experience with teaching. In no ways am I equating my experience to theirs, nor am I hoping to appear as an expert on the subject matter. I'd like to present myself as someone who is currently going through all the trials and tribulations of being a teaching assistant. Through this post, I hope to provide solace if you're experiencing similar problems, or maybe ways you could look to improve. 

It's always to get more knowledge and opinions out into the world. By providing my own experience, I hope to help find answers to questions and methodologies that others may find useful.

Any comments, questions, or concerns can be directed to my email:

# Successes:

I've chosen a few stories that I'd like to tell that I think of fondly in my work experiences. 

There was a particular student that I had last semester who I particularly enjoyed helping. She was always enthusiastic about the material, and her enjoyment and self fulfillment from coming to a solution with my help made my days. I remember in particular the first time we met in lab. She had told me that she was a Freshman[^1] and was unsure that she was correctly placed into this course[^2].

[^1]: Freshman, Fall semester;  a very stressful time 
[^2]: CSCI 1913, the second course in one of the introduction tracks which focuses on algorithms and data structures.

# Questions and Answers:

*What do you do when everything goes wrong?*

The first thing to do when 'everything' goes wrong is to acknowledge that you don't know why it's going wrong. I've found that being honest with students usually leads to better interactions. You're not a TA because you have an encyclopedic knowledge of Python, you're a TA because of your ability to communicate concepts and problem solve. Showing your students that ability will go further for you and them than struggling through a half-baked answer.

*How can I help someone when I don't know exactly how to help?*

Start with what their problem is. Ask very clear, targeted questions to try and outline the problem. From there do debugging, either literally or figuratively based on your circumstances. I typically look over their assignment or lab handout alongside them and verbally walk through it with them. It helps me get a sense of what may be going on. Talking through each line of their code or assignment could also be a good strategy. Sometimes the computer misses a small problem in syntax or the student will make a small error that isn't obvious on a macro scale. 

> ex. if you're in an entry C++ course and a student accidentally uses a & bitwise operator instead of the && comparison operator, it would be hard for them to diagnose and for the computer to pick up on.

*Should I be a friend or an authority?*

Yes.

Draw the line in the sand where you see fit. I enjoy being amicable to my students, so I make more friendships with them. I enjoy recognizing them in classes or around campus, it makes for a more inclusive department all-in-all. The line in the sand is that I realize their my students, I'm not asking them to hang out or meet up for coffee. 

The administrative side comes up where I don't play favorites or grade on a bias for students I like. Sure, there are students I have more of a connection with than others, but they are all treated fairly in grading.
